<p>I'm a current doctoral candidate at Georg-August Universität Göttingen, where I'm part of the Research Training Group 'Form-meaning mismatches' (RTG:2636). My project "The semantics of plural morphology in select Niger-Congo; Kwa languages" looks at the interaction of number morphology with the mass-count distinction in Asante Twi, Avatime, and Logba. When not doing linguistics, I enjoy knitting, running, and reading </p>
